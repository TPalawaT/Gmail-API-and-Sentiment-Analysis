# Gmail-API-and-Sentiment-Analysis

##Overview
Send a request to Gmail API and shows subject of first five messages which might be congratulating the receiver.</br>
This uses Gmail API call to return user's messages and then uses python NLTK library for text parsing and returns the subject of the first five mail which satisfy the condition.</br>

##Requirements
Requirements to run the program are:-
> **Python 3.x**
> **Pickle-** This comes installed with python package
> **Gmail API call modules** pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
> **nltk-** 1. pip install -U nltk
            2. Open python interpreter
            3. Type nltk.download()
            4. From the dialog box, select choices and download
            
##Further Developments
Gmail API is very extensive but at the same time, very difficult to understand.</br>
I'll try and make python scripts for the major API calls as tutorial.
